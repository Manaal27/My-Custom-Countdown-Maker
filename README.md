# My-Custom-Countdown-Maker

# requirements for the project

1. # Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS front-end that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.
2. # Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.
3. # Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).
4. # Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a “like” button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.
5. # Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
4. # Stretch Goals
# Use json-server (Links to an external site.) in your project to persist your app’s interactivity.

# Project Description
1) create a title for your countdown in the countdown input box #special Occasion i.e graduation ceremony.

# About Project
this poject gives you an ability to write an html with a link to its style css that helps put features like background photos and a video and proper design to the project and a javaScript to help communicate to the server i.e when we input our special ocassion and date and time and the countdown displayed.

I choose this project because it enables me work through all the things i learnt in this Phase 1,from learning to make DOMContent loaded to different types of event listeners and to having json server.

# Guidelines for making a test in script.js
 // Elements

 // Global Variables 

 // Time Variables

 // Set date input minimum with todays date 

 / Populate countdown / complete UI 

  // Get the time between Jan 1, 1970 to the entered date, returned in milliseconds.  

  // Split up the time held in distance into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.  

   // Hide Input

   // If countdown has ended, show complete messaging

    // Else, Show countdown in progress  
    // Populate the countdown  

    // Take Values from form input

    // Check for valid date  

    // Get the numbner version of current date and update DOM  

    // Reset all values  

    // Hide Countdown and show input

    // Stop the countdown 

    // Reset Values 

    // Get the countdown from localStorage if available
